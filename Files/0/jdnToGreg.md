**One period** is 400 proleptic Gregorian calendar years.

**A node** is the moment that one period begins and another
ends.

**Each period is aligned** with four centuries.
I.e, the beginning of a period coincides with the beginning of
a century.

**A leap century** is a century having one more leap year
(and therefore one more leap day) than a **typical century**.

**The natural palce** a leap day is at the *end* of the year.
Therefore the natrual place for the exceptional-exceptional
yeap year (each 400 years) is at the *end* of the period.
