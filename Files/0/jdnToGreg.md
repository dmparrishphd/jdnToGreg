**One period** is 400 proleptic Gregorian calendar years.
Furthermore, the last day of a period is February 29-th and
the number of the year of that February 29-th is on a multiple
of 400 (e.g., 1600, 2000, 2400). Consequently, the first day
of a given period is March 1, four hundred yeaars less one day
prior to the afore-mentioned February 29-th.

**The natural palce** for a leap day is at the *end* of the year.
Therefore the natrual place for the exceptional-exceptional
yeap year (each 400 years) is at the *end* of the period.

**A node** is the moment that one period begins and another
ends.

**Each period is aligned** with exactly four centuries.
The first day of each of these centuries is March 1.
The beginning of a period coincides with the beginning of
a century.

**A leap century** is a century having one more leap year
(and therefore one more leap day) than a **typical century**.
